## Guardian Backend

This repository is an attempt to write the backend of Warden/Garden, entirely in Go,
and based upon the docker/libcontainer low-level container library.

It is “work-in-progress” and is not available for redistribution.

    We don't want you copying our half-baked prototypes and then
blaming us.

    We'll open source this when we are ready, thank you.
